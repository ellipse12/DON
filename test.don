//directive example. ~* is also a directive but in infix form. Directives can be any
//symbol other than # (prefix) and ~(infix). infix can only take two arguments.
//Inner directives are evaluated before outer ones.
//Directives are defined progromatically by the processor.
//def is a inbuilt directive that preforms string substitution wherever it sees TAU
//#def TAU 2 ~* "obj.PI"
